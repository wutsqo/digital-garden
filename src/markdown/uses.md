### Laptop

**Asus A407UF (2018 - Present)**

This is a laptop I bought when I was still in my final high school year. Not that good in terms of hardware specifications. But it lasts and I'm proud of it nonetheless since I bought this with my hard-earned money. Also, it got gradual upgrades over time.

- Windows 10 + WSL 2 Ubuntu 20.04
- Intel Core i3 7020U + Nvidia GeForce MX130
- 12GB RAM DDR4
- 256GB SSD + 1TB HDD

**Philips Monitor 242E2FE (2022 - Present)**

A monitor I bought after a couple of months of saving (along with the keyboard below). The quality is great for its price range. Also, its bezel-less feature fits in perfectly with the aesthetic of my minimalist desk.
